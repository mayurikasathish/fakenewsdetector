# fakenewsdetector
With all the misinformation floating around, I wanted to build something that could help identify fake news. This project uses text classification to analyze news articles and predict whether they're legit or not.
Tech stack:
Python
Pandas & NumPy (data handling)
Scikit-learn (ML models)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualizations)
Jupyter Notebook

Dataset:
Using the ISOT Fake News Dataset with ~45k articles (23k fake, 21k real) covering political and world news from 2016-2017.
